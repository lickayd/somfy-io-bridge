"""Somfy IO (io-homecontrol) cover platform.

One IOHCCover = one bonded virtual remote identity (IOHC::IOHCRemote1W),
talking to one physical motor over the 1W-style command layer ported in
iohc_remote1w.h/.cpp - see that file for why 1W (not the harder 2W
challenge/response) is the right target for direct control, and iohc.h for
why this whole component is a flat/subdirectory-per-platform layout.

Position feedback is normally a local estimate (BlindPosition, travel-time
based), not real motor feedback - hence is_assumed_state(true) in
get_traits() regardless of whether motor_address is set. If motor_address IS
set (the shutter's real Somfy address, NOT the node/key identity below - see
README's "Real position feedback" section), this cover ALSO gets passively
updated with the motor's own real reported position whenever an already-
2W-bonded controller (e.g. TaHoma/Connexoon) is overheard talking to it -
see IOHCComponent::on_receive() in iohc.cpp. Requires such a controller to
already exist and be active; this bridge cannot query position on its own.
