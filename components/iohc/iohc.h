// Thin ESPHome wrapper around the vendored io-homecontrol radio stack (the
// other files in this same directory - ported from
// https://github.com/rspaargaren/iohomecontrol, Apache-2.0). Flat layout is
// required: ESPHome's external_components resource discovery only looks at
// a component's own top-level directory, not subdirectories (confirmed in
// esphome/loader.py's Component.resources - "does not look through
// subdirectories"), so a vendor/ subfolder silently doesn't get copied into
// the build at all. This component owns none of the radio logic itself - it
// just starts IOHC::iohcRadio on ESPHome's setup() and logs whatever comes
// in. Phase 0/1 scope: prove real reception, single fixed channel, no
// TX/pairing.

  // Fast cooperative 3-channel RX hop (Finding 31/32) - DISABLED (CH2 only)
  // by default. Deliberately NOT built on iohcRadio's own ISR-driven
  // num_freqs/tickerCounter auto-hop mechanism (which stays permanently
  // disabled, num_freqs=1) - that's a genuine hardware interrupt and can
  // preempt mid-instruction, which would race against the
  // retune()-then-send() sequence every TX call site relies on. This hop
  // instead mirrors how github.com/laberning/home_io_control's own
  // reference implementation actually achieves its documented ~2.7ms hop
  // cadence: a cooperative maybe_hop()-style check with no interrupt
  // involved, so it can only ever run between top-level calls, never mid-TX
  // - no critical section needed, nothing to race.
  //
  // Why disabled by default (Finding 32, real-hardware regression): every
  // 1W frame (any remote) and the vast majority of ordinary 2W traffic
  // (TaHoma's own routine polling of already-bonded motors) is CH2-only in
  // practice - confirmed by this entire project's history of reliable
  // CH2-only decode, and by proto_timing.h's own "commands are sent on
  // CH2" statement. The reference hops continuously by default because
  // it's an ACTIVE controller: if a response lands on the wrong channel,
  // it can just retry its own command. This bridge's passive decode of
  // TaHoma's traffic has no such retry available - one missed frame is
  // just gone. Confirmed on real hardware: with the hop always on, a full
  // 7-minute capture caught every 2W exchange but zero 1W frames from a
  // physical remote pressed repeatedly during that window.
  //
  // Two independent callers can each request the hop - the dedicated
  // "Channel Hop (2W)" switch (somfy-io-bridge.yaml,
  // deliberately separate from Debug Logging - opportunistic background
  // sniffing is a distinct concern from log verbosity, and running it
  // unattended for a long stretch shouldn't require also paying for
  // continuous VERY_VERBOSE logging) and IOHCController2W::arm_bonding()
  // (the ~60s DISCOVER-wait window) - tracked separately so one's request
  // ending doesn't kill the other's still-active one.

  // still transmits 1W commands normally, but stops continuously decoding
  // every frame on the channel the way it normally does. Real Situo remotes
  // don't do this at all. Added to test whether this bridge's own
  // continuous RX/decode load - not present on a Situo - is what's
  // colliding with TaHoma's own concurrent polling of motors. Defaults
